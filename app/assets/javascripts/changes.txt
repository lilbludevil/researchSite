- Implemented compatibility with CopperCube 4.2 (that is, normal map support for example)

- All shaders now have access to a variable 'worldtransform', storing the world transformation of the current object.

- Fixed a bug in scripting engine in the WebGL target causing changing target and upvector of cameras not to work sometimes

- Fixed a bug causing animated meshes sometimes not to be lighted correctly when rotated


---------------------------------------------
CopperLicht 1.6.2
---------------------------------------------

- Fixed a problem causing model viewer cameras not to work anymore in Chrome 27 in the WebGL target.

- Implemented compatibility with CopperCube 4.0.4

- Light scene nodes didn't return their type for a getType() call, this is fixed now.


---------------------------------------------
CopperLicht 1.6.1
---------------------------------------------

- Improved font rendering: Text is now more clearly readable

- Implemented compatibility with CopperCube 4.0.3

- Fixed a small memory leak when drawing particle systems

- Fixed a bug which caused a cloned mesh scene node not to clone its mesh but to reuse the mesh reference.

- Fixed a bug causing the wrong amount of materials to be returned from animated meshes


---------------------------------------------
CopperLicht 1.6 
---------------------------------------------

- Added support for Particle Systems. Use the ParticleSceneNode to create smoke, fire, rain, fog, whatever you like.

- There is now a mobile 2d input scene node available which behaves like the overlay 2d scene node and can be used
  to emulate keyboard input for games on touchscreen devices like phones, tablets and similar.

- The Overlay2D Scene node now supports multi-line text. Also, the text drawing API has been extended for configurating text more precicely (fonts, colors, alignment, etc)
  
- CopperLicht now has an automatic loading screen when loading. You can disable it by setting the parameter 'loadingScreenText' of startCopperLichtFromFile to null.

- Billboard rendering speed has been increased by a factor of about 600%

- Vector3D now has functions to interpolate between vectors, and to rotate it along all three axes.

- Full compatibility with the CopperCube 4 editor


---------------------------------------------
CopperLicht 1.5
---------------------------------------------

- Added support for vertex colors. You can colorize each part of each 3d geometry separately now. 
  CL3D.Vertex3D has a member named 'Color', using this causes 3d models to be colorized.

- Dynamic lighting is now more physically correct. 
  In fact, it is now exactly looking as in the fixed function pipeline of Direct3D and OpenGL

- Changed default rotation speed for the CameraModelViewer animator to be more useful.

- Fixed a bug causing stopping of sounds not to work

- Fixed a bug causing animations not to be played when setting a frame loop which exceeded the maximal existing frame amount.

---------------------------------------------

- Big performance increase in all parts of the engine: Removed code initializing Vect3D unnecessarily

- Fixed a bug causing the scene not to load when a StopSound action was used.

- Fixed a bug causing a "Set Animation" action not to work when read from a .ccbjs file


---------------------------------------------
CopperLicht 1.4.1
---------------------------------------------

- Added documentation for the dynamic light feature

---------------------------------------------

- Dynamic light is now supported.

- CopperLicht now supports the backface culling flag for every material. Enabling a way to use double sided
  materials in the 3D scene.
  
- Internet Explorer is now supported as well. Although this browser doesn't support WebGL, you can run CopperLicht now
  perfectly using the IEWebGL plugin. There is also now a copperlicht_ie.js file available on our website to
  help you using CopperLicht in InternetExplorer.
  
- CopperLicht now supports all features of Coppercube 3
  
- Updated to support new features of the CopperCube editor (i.e. dynamic frames per second counter)

- Fixed a bug in firefox: When playing animated meshes in a WebGL scene, firefox got slower and slower.
  This is caused by a memory leak bug in firefox, but CopperLicht is now aware of this and improves the situation.
  
- All triangle selectors now have the option to specify a node to ignore, which is useful to
  prevent collisions for example of a scene node against itself.
  
- Pressing keys assigned to behaviors or actions like camera controllers will no
  longer cause that key presses to propagate to the browser, causing it to for example scroll unwantedly.
  
---------------------------------------------
CopperLicht 1.3.7
---------------------------------------------

- Firefox 5 doesn't allow loading textures from different domains (and from local disk) anymore. There is now an error message indicating this problem.

- Fixed a bug when drawing materials for lightmaps generated in CopperCube, when only using vertex colors


---------------------------------------------

  the CL3D.CopperCubeVariable interface
  
- The AnimatorCameraFPS now has a new method to change the mouse input method:

- Fixed a bug causing the 'when a cursor moved over do something' behavior created 
  by CopperCube to trigger also when the object is hidden behind another object.

- The mouse positions are now also correct if the canvas is embedded in a div with relative position

----------------------------------------------
CopperLicht 1.3.2
---------------------------------------------

- There is a new Material available now: EMT_REFLECTION_2_LAYER, a
  simple fake reflection.
  
- There is a new Material available now: EMT_TRANSPARENT_REFLECTION_2_LAYER, a
  simple fake reflection similar to the new EMT_REFLECTION_2_LAYER, but supporting  
  a transparent alpha channel.

---------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------
CopperLicht 1.3.0
---------------------------------------------

- The JavaScript library CopperLicht is now placed in the namespace CL3D. 
  Note that when creating new instaces of or accessing CopperLicht classes, you need
  to prefix it with the new namespace. Creating a 3d vector for example previously 
  worked like this:
	var v = new Vect3d();
  now works like this:
    var v = new CL3D.Vect3d();
  This also makes it compatible for using it with other libraries, for example
  jQuery.
  
- The source of the library is now only minificated and not obfuscated anymore, 
  making it much easier to debug it.
  
- Added a OnChangeMaterial callback to Renderer for more fine grained control over 
  modifying shader variables.
  
- The 'Core' class has been removed. All its functions are now inside the
  CL3D namespace
  
- Shaders in tutorial 5 have been updated to work with latest WebGL browsers.

- Fixed a bug causing cursor keys not to work correctly with the AnimatorCameraFPS
  in Chrome, sometimes
  
- Added a createClone() function to meshes to create a copy of a mesh
